# SPAM-SMS-DETECTION
This project uses Logistic Regression to classify SMS messages as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The text data is processed using TF-IDF vectorization, and the Logistic Regression model is trained to detect spam with high accuracy. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in identifying unwanted messages.
